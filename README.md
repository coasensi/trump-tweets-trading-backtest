complete strategy backtest
trading strategy comparison for every ticker available on yfinance

conclusions:

Bollinger bands and mean reversion strategies generally exhibit negative returns with upward trending financial assets.

Among the five tested, the momentum trading strategy is the most likely to overperform the buy and hold strategy.

The trading strategy based on Donald Trump tweets sentiment analysis generally offers interesting returns on volatile assets.
